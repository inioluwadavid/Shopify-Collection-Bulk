2. **Describe the use case** and why it would be valuable
3. **Provide examples** of how the feature would work
4. **Consider implementation complexity** and maintainability

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Run tests** (if available): `npm test`

#### Development Process

1. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Use descriptive titles** that explain what the PR does
- **Provide detailed descriptions** of changes made
- **Reference related issues** using `#issue-number`
- **Include screenshots** for UI changes
- **Ensure all checks pass** before requesting review

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js

- **Use ES6+ features** (the project uses ES modules)
- **Follow consistent naming**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Handle errors gracefully** with try-catch blocks

### Code Style

```javascript
// Good
const createCollection = async (collectionData) => {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/collections', collectionData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create collection:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Avoid
const createCollection = async (data) => {
  const res = await apiClient.post('/collections', data);
  return res.data;
};
```

### File Organization

- **Keep scripts focused** on single responsibilities
- **Use descriptive filenames**
- **Group related functionality** together
- **Export functions** that might be reused

## Testing
